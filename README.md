# Robot_Car_Racer
This is my personal project that I worked on through an online Robotics course by TI and UTexas. Most of the hardware was put together, 
but I wanted to write the software on my own and develop my embedded design skills. It consists of a ARM-based microcontroller, DC motors,
an LCD screen for a debug display, and bump switches and IR sensors to navigate. I wrote about 95% of the code and I have it currently 
making full rounds around the kitchen without any crashes.
