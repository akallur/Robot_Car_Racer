# Robot_Car_Racer
This is my personal project that I worked on through an online Robotics course by TI and UTexas. Most of the hardware was put together, 
but I wanted to write the software on my own and develop my embedded design skills. It consists of a ARM-based microcontroller, DC motors,
an LCD screen for a debug display, and bump switches and IR sensors to navigate. I wrote about 95% of the code and I have it currently 
making full rounds around the kitchen without any crashes. The end goal is to control the robot car from my PC and have video streaming 
back as well, so I can race it around as I want.

In the works of integrating I2C functionality for use with laser-ranging sensors. These sensors will be used for rear navigation and preventing
rear collisions on the car.
